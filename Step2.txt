Now that you know the basics of binding, let's get more familiar with the routing. 

There are files created for 3 components. By convention it's an HTML file for the template and a JS file for the View Model.

Our form from the previous step is now available in the 'welcome' component.

Add a routing configuration to the app with routes corresponding to the components' names in app.js and look at app.html.
