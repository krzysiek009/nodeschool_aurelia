Time to get to know the Fetch method.

Aurelia comes with a polyfill for browsers that don't yet support it and it's the recommended way of getting resources.

That is convenient, because that's also what Service Workers are using - keep that in mind for later.

Modify users.js according to the comment. Be sure to check it out again in the next step to see the async/await version.
