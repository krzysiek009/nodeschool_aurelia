We have the routing configured, but no one wants to have to type the routes by hand.

Let's add a navigation bar. The nav-bar component file is prepared. 

That's right, just one file - all the data comes from the router, that is called an HTML-only element.
( for the very curious https://github.com/aurelia/templating/blob/master/doc/article/en-US/templating-html-behaviors-introduction.md#html-only-custom-elements)

Add it to the app.html file and use the repeat behaviour to loop over the routes.
